                            <h3 class="belz">Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h3>
                              <p>There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there 
                                is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and experienced 
                                problem solvers who can design creative solutions. </p>
                                <p>The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business globally, 
                                  and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing.</p>
                                 <h3 class="belz">What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of The Course?</h3>
                                <p>By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the most used web-based programming language – JavaScript. You’ll 
                                  have built several full-stack applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a development environment.</p>
                                  <p>You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. You’ll have gained foundational skill in many disciplines 
                                    that touch web development – managing complex data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords, and testing and deploying your 
                                    applications to prepare them to scale.</p>
                                  <h3 class="belz">Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h3>
                                  <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course will walk you 
                                    through installing the necessary free software. </p>
                                    <p>At least, you’ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous programming language experience is required.</p>
